        Here we can see an example of a code exercise. With these exercises, beyond answering multiple-choice questions, 
        you can test what you have learned throughout the course. Although they are optional, these exercises can help you verify that you really 
        master the material, or discover that you have some unanswered questions. 

        This first exercise is a test, and it is just for you to familiarize yourself with the tool. You don't have to do anything. The exercise is already solved.
